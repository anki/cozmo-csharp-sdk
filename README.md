# cozmo-csharp-sdk
Anki Cozmo CSharp Example Interface

Anki will not be actively maintaining this project at this time.  The project is meant to show how a c# project could be built that interacts with Cozmo, but is not a complete SDK comparable to the actively maintained python repository.

The included project can be built on osx via Xamarin studio. or windows via Visual Studio.  The project is a sample app which demonstrates how to send a specific action and register for specific callbacks.  This approach should scale to the other message types in clad DLL.  The app also provides bindings to package and unpackage tcp packets intercepted from the cozmo app to and from clad messages.
